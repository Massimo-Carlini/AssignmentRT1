Python Robotics Simulator
================================

This is a simple, portable robot simulator developed by [Student Robotics](https://studentrobotics.org).
Some of the arenas and the exercises have been modified for the Research Track I course

Installing and running
----------------------

The simulator requires a Python 2.7 installation, the [pygame](http://pygame.org/) library, [PyPyBox2D](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypybox2d/2.1-r331), and [PyYAML](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML/).

Once the dependencies are installed, simply run the `test.py` script to test out the simulator.


Robot API
---------

The API for controlling a simulated robot is designed to be as similar as possible to the [SR API][sr-api].

### Motors ###

The simulated robot has two motors configured for skid steering, connected to a two-output [Motor Board](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/kit/motor_board). The left motor is connected to output `0` and the right motor to output `1`.

The Motor Board API is identical to [that of the SR API](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/programming/sr/motors/), except that motor boards cannot be addressed by serial number. So, to turn on the spot at one quarter of full power, one might write the following:

```python
R.motors[0].m0.power = 25
R.motors[0].m1.power = -25
```

### The Grabber ###

The robot is equipped with a grabber, capable of picking up a token which is in front of the robot and within 0.4 metres of the robot's centre. To pick up a token, call the `R.grab` method:

```python
success = R.grab()
```

The `R.grab` function returns `True` if a token was successfully picked up, or `False` otherwise. If the robot is already holding a token, it will throw an `AlreadyHoldingSomethingException`.

To drop the token, call the `R.release` method.

Cable-tie flails are not implemented.

### Vision ###

To help the robot find tokens and navigate, each token has markers stuck to it, as does each wall. The `R.see` method returns a list of all the markers the robot can see, as `Marker` objects. The robot can only see markers which it is facing towards.

Each `Marker` object has the following attributes:

* `info`: a `MarkerInfo` object describing the marker itself. Has the following attributes:
  * `code`: the numeric code of the marker.
  * `marker_type`: the type of object the marker is attached to (either `MARKER_TOKEN_GOLD`, `MARKER_TOKEN_SILVER` or `MARKER_ARENA`).
  * `offset`: offset of the numeric code of the marker from the lowest numbered marker of its type. For example, token number 3 has the code 43, but offset 3.
  * `size`: the size that the marker would be in the real game, for compatibility with the SR API.
* `centre`: the location of the marker in polar coordinates, as a `PolarCoord` object. Has the following attributes:
  * `length`: the distance from the centre of the robot to the object (in metres).
  * `rot_y`: rotation about the Y axis in degrees.
* `dist`: an alias for `centre.length`
* `res`: the value of the `res` parameter of `R.see`, for compatibility with the SR API.
* `rot_y`: an alias for `centre.rot_y`
* `timestamp`: the time at which the marker was seen (when `R.see` was called).

For example, the following code lists all of the markers the robot can see:

```python
markers = R.see()
print "I can see", len(markers), "markers:"

for m in markers:
    if m.info.marker_type in (MARKER_TOKEN_GOLD, MARKER_TOKEN_SILVER):
        print " - Token {0} is {1} metres away".format( m.info.offset, m.dist )
    elif m.info.marker_type == MARKER_ARENA:
        print " - Arena marker {0} is {1} metres away".format( m.info.offset, m.dist )
```

### Pseudocode ###

silver_code <- list
golden_code <- list

find_token_silver()
	function to find the closest silver token
	dist <- 100
	for token in R.see():
    		if code of token silver is not in silver_code:list
			if distance of token < dist and color of token == 'silver':
				dist <- distance of token
				rot_y <- angle of token
				s_code <- silver code
		
		
    if dist = 100:
	return -1, -1, -1
    else:
   	return dist, rot_y, s_code
   	
   	
find_token_gold():
	Function to find the closest golden token

	
	dist <- 100
	for token in R.see():
		if code of token gold is not in silver_code:list:
			if distance of token < dist and color of token = 'gold':
				dist <- token.dist
				rot_y <- token.rot_y
				g_code <- token.info.code
		
	if dist = 100:
		return -1, -1, -1
	else:
	   	return dist, rot_y, g_code
   	
   	
grab_token(code_silver:list)
	Function to grab the silver token and then release it if we are close to golden token

	if I take the token:
		add the silver code to list
		release <- True
		
		while release:
			dist_gold, rot_gold, code_gold <- find_token_gold()
			if(dist == -1)
				turn the robot
			else if(dist_silver < d_th)
				release the silver token
				make a step back with the robot
				add the golden token at his list
				release <- False
			else if(-a_th <= rot_gold <= a_th)
				go on with the robot
			else if(rot_gold < -a_th)
				turn left
			else if(rot_gold > a_th)
				turn right
		
		
main()
	
	while 1:
	
		dist_silver, rot_silver, code_silver <- find_token_silver()
		
		if((len(silver_code) == 6) and (len(golden_code) == 6))
			exit
		if(dist_silver == -1)
			turn the robot
		else if(dist_silver < d_th)
			grab_token(code_silver)	
		else if(-a_th < rot_silver < a_th)
			go on with the robot	
		else if(rot_silver < -a_th)
			turn left
		else if(rot_silver > a_th)
			turn right
			
### Possible improvement ###
A possible improvement could be to optimize the search for the closest tokens, by having the robot do a mapping of the environment and update the position of the tokens when it moves
